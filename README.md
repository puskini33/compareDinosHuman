### Big Picture

This javascript project displays an infographic that is derived from locally saved data, as well as user input data. 
The user submits information about themselves via a form. After submission, a 3x3 grid of tiles is generated (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. All the other tiles will contain information about dinosaurs.
Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. The facts displayed are random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts (3 should be from the methods you create).
One of the titles is a pigeon in which the tile will always display, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”

Information about the Project's Big Picture was partially taken from here: https://github.com/udacity/Javascript.
